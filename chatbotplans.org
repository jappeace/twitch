* TODO Fix docs, just ms for timers
  It was hard to figure out how to use this the first time around

* TODO Document command langauge?
  I just looked at the stream to figure it out

* TODO Document custom commands
I want to add the custom commands to help page directly.
  
I think it's related to this but less ambitious:

We'll split up the org file with headings. Eg:
** Builtin
   | name | description | source definition |

** Custom

   | name | definition |

* TODO Make link to schedule configurable
* TODO Markov on timer doesn't use right botname
* TODO Add hoogle support
  w/ hoogle server it'd be possible to allow chat to look up typesignatures

* TODO Shitpost command
  Allow users to post images to view later?
  
* TODO Use a WS connection to fetch a sentence from text synth given a seed
