On occasion I talk about random blogposts/talks.

I don't want to reference to hackage directly.
I'm interested in *opinions*,
naturally any blogpost
that excuses themselves for having opinions is probably *not*
interestning.
Also if posts make references/citations
to other posts they're more valuable.

Feel free to submit your own with a PR, or simply on the [discord](https://discord.gg/Hp4agqy) blogpost channel.

### Should use haskell for my startup?
  These are some of my own comments with regards to that video.
  I'm somewhat defensive, but I think I've made the right decision still.
  I'm still Rust curious.
#### Can get stuff done?
      I already knew most libraries (eg servant, beam) only
      reflex was experimental really.
#### Can find people?
      I think haskell is very popular, for example
      the initial haskell meetup in amsterdam was bascially sold out
      first day.
#### Try new if have time?
      The haskell choice wasn't new for me,
      reflex was but I gave it a couple of weeks to try out.
      I was happy w/ initial results, otherwise I would've swtiched away.
      Speed is still an issue for reflex.
      Maybe on opensource day we'll try investigating ghcjs at some point.

### High risk
      Buisness model hasn't been proven:
      I think saas has been proven,
      I just need to make sure I can sell it.
